<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>
	I was born and raised in Aurora, Illinois alongside an older brother and sister. Currently, I am living in Iowa City with my friend
 and girlfriend above the Vine (dollar drinks on Monday!). I chose to attend classes at the University of Iowa over Illinois and Wisconsin
 because of the generous scholarships I was awarded here and I have no regrets; Iowa City is a wondeful town. Since I started attending in 
 2015, I have worked as a security officer and I am currently working at American Eagle at the Coral Ridge Mall. 
 </p>
 
 <p>
	When I am not at class or work, I like to spend my time driving my awesome 2015 Volkswagen Golf GTI (it's f*ckin quick). I consider
	myself a car enthusiast, having owned a 2007 Civic Si before my GTI. I really enjoy the feeling of shifting gears and controlling a fun,
	sporty car and I use that as a motivator to lead a successful career. My hopes are that I make enough money after college to afford a
	weekend car for track days. For now	I am content frightening my passengers in my little VW.
